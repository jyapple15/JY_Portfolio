In this module, I learned to use R for data analysis and visualisation. Using the tools gained and further exploration of my own, I created a data story as my final project. 

<u>Final Project</u><br>
This final project communicates insights from the data source named "<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jswicker/the-smell-of-fear/">The Smell of Fear</a>". It aims to answer the question whether a smell of fear exists.
