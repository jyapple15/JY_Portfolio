<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is a datastory that aims to answer whether a smell of fear exists. It communicates insights from the data source named "<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jswicker/the-smell-of-fear/">The Smell of Fear</a>". 

I created it as a part of my final project in the module NM2207 Computational Media Literacy. In the module, I learned to use R for data analysis and visualisation. Using the tools gained and further exploration of my own, I created this final project.</p>
